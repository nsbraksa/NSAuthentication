NSAuthentication
================

# iOS app 

1. Make sure you have cocoapods installed

        $ sudo gem install cocoapods 
        $ pod setup
    

2. Change directory to NSAuthentication and install the necessary pods (pods are like gems for iOS) 

        $ pod install 
    
    
    
# Rails app (where the web service lives) 

1. Install necessary gems 

        $ bundle install
