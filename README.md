NSAuthentication
================

# Getting Started

### iOS app 

1. Make sure you have cocoapods installed

        $ sudo gem install cocoapods 
        $ pod setup
    
2. Go inside the NSAuthentication directory (the one you just cloned obviously) and install the necessary pods (pods are like gems for iOS) 

        $ pod install 

3. From now on, open `AuthExample.xcworkspace` instead of opening `AuthExample.xcodeproj`, because Cocoapods requires you to do that !
